-----------------
FlatBuffers API for C: see https://github.com/dvidelabs/flatcc

Flatcc this is NOT part of the ObjectBox C API itself.
If you want to use ObjectBox in a C application, you should manage a flatcc dependency yourself.

You can use libobjectbox in another language than C with a FlatBuffers library for that language.
